# Online Journal App
## Marion Okondo

For my project, I created an app that a user will use to journal their thoughts without having to do it traditionally.

The purpose of this app is to aid users to keep track of their thoughts and memories with security measures to protect their personal info. 

## Setup and Instructions

Before you open our code, make sure to:

- Make sure to fork and clone it to your terminal
- Cd Online-journal
- Navigate to your VS Code then open the VS Code terminal
- npm install
- npm run dev to get the react app running

## Core Features

- Register and Login
- Can add an entry
- Can update an entry
- Can delete an entry
- Can update their profile
- Can view all their entries which are sorted by date created
- Can logout

## Usage

When you open the page, the user is directed to login to access the main dashboard. If they do not have an account, they need to create one to access the dashboard.

In the dashboard, the user will see all their entries, an option to add an entry, view a single entry, view their profile, see an about page which has more information concerning the journal app, and logout.

There's also a footer which will link the user to my (supposed) social media accounts to maintain a connection.
